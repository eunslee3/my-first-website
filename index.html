            Volleyball is a sport that I've been getting into
            lately. It's a fun sport where people of all levels
            are able to play without feeling burdened by the gap
            of skill level. As it is a team sport, support amongst
            team members are important for a fun and competitive
            experience. In this about me, I want to share a little about myself and my experience with this sport.

            I am a 22-year-old aspiring software engineer. I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the spring of 2022. 
            Since graduation, I started to explore different career avenues since I wasn't very satisfied with the course I was heading. After doing my
            best of exploring and learning new skills, I found coding! This was right after I completed a UX design course and I found coding to be up my alley.
            Designing is fun and all but I think my mind is more geared towards logical thinking than it is abstract. One of my goals by the end of this bootcamp
            is to create an app for a student organization that I was a part of. They struggle with keeping track of members and notifying them of events and competitions.
            I want to create an app, specifically for the executive board, where they can keep track of members, give them announcements, and track active members.

            One of my hobbies, as of now, is playing volleyball! It helps me to take off my mind off of stressful events and
            is a great form of exercise! After the COVID-19 pandemic, volleyball communities lost its touch
            and many gyms who held recreational volleyball ceased their operations. However, at long last a gym has
            opened their facilities to gym goers to play volleyball. The community is very nice and competitive. I hope to spread the fun 
            with other people and create a community of volleyball loving players.
